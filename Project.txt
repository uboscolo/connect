Create a connection class in Python

Summary:

This class provides the user with methods to connect, reconnect, disconnect and send commands to a remote ip address via either ssh or telnet, by reading some parameters such as ip addresses, usernames and passwords from a input text file in yaml format

# I made this change for the purpose of testing reviews

Methods:

- connect
- reconnect
- disconnect
- send_command
- set_prompt
- add_prompt

Input file format:

devices:
    <device_name>:
        ip_address: <IP ADDRESS>
        username: <USERNAME>
        password: <password>
        prompt: <prompt>
        protocol: <SSH OR TELNET>
        options:
            <OPTION_1>: <VAL_1>

Implementation details:

- 1 class to parse the input file and return paramaters is needed
- connection cass should either extend or reference pexpect 
- Unit test for all the public methods 
- PEP 8 compliant, 0 pylint errors or warnings 

Unit test strategy
- a subfolder called test should be associated for all the classes
- python unitest can be used to write the unittest, and either unitest or 
  nosetest use to check pass/fail rate and coverage, aim is 100% pass 
  and 100% coverage
